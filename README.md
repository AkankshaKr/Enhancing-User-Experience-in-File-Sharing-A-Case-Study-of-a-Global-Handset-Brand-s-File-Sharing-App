# Enhancing-User-Experience-in-File-Sharing-A-Case-Study-of-a-Global-Handset-Brand-s-File-Sharing-App
During our recent internship, we delved into the world of file-sharing applications, focusing on a specific global handset brand to analyze its comparative usage and popularity against a prominent competitor. Our objective was to understand why this particular application, despite being integrated into its own ecosystem, wasn't as widely embraced as its counterpart, Airdrop.  
Our journey commenced with an in-depth exploration of various products across the tech spectrum, encompassing handsets, smart TVs, laptops, tablets, smart earphones, and smartwatches. We meticulously dissected the features that contribute to the allure and effectiveness of competing ecosystems, laying the groundwork for our subsequent analysis.  
Conducting a thorough competitive audit, we embarked on visits to different brand stores, immersing ourselves in the user experience and garnering insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each platform. Complementing these observations, we conducted surveys, contextual inquiries, and interviews, tailoring our questions to demographic nuances and device-related challenges.  
Our interviews specifically focused on aspects crucial to file sharing, including interoperability, real-time sharing capabilities, large file sharing, organization and storage, historical tracking, security, privacy considerations, and user urgency. We cast a wide net, initially targeting individuals with ample internet access before diversifying to encompass those with limited connectivity, as well as older demographics.  
Narrowing our focus, each group within our internship cohort tackled a specific facet of file sharing dynamics. Our group, in particular, honed in on bulk sharing, refining our interview questions and analysis to address this aspect comprehensively.  
Drawing from our research findings, we crafted innovative solutions and recommendations, leveraging prototyping and wireframing techniques. Our proposals prioritize speed, security, and user-centric design principles, aiming to provide a unified and intuitive connected experience for users.
