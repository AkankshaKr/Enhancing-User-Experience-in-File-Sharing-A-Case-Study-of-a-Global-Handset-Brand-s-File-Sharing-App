# Enhancing-User-Experience-in-File-Sharing-A-Case-Study-of-a-Global-Handset-Brand-s-File-Sharing-App
 During our internship at Samsung, we delved into the functionalities and user experience of Quick Share, Samsung's proprietary file-sharing application. Our objective was to understand why Quick Share hadn't gained as much traction as its competitor, Airdrop, despite being integrated into Samsung's extensive ecosystem. 

Our approach began with a meticulous study of various products within Samsung's ecosystem, including handsets, smart TVs, laptops, tablets, smart earphones, and smartwatches. We then conducted a comparative analysis, examining the features that contribute to the popularity of ecosystems from other companies. 

To gain deeper insights, we embarked on a comprehensive competitive audit, visiting different brand stores and conducting surveys, contextual inquiries, and interviews. Our focus spanned across demographics and device-related issues, honing in on aspects like interoperability, real-time sharing, organization and storage, security, privacy, and user urgency. 

Dividing our research into specific user groups—ranging from those with excess internet access to those with limited connectivity, including older adults—we tailored our inquiries accordingly. Our group specifically concentrated on bulk sharing, refining our interview questions to address this aspect more comprehensively. 

With our findings in hand, we devised innovative solutions and recommendations, leveraging prototyping and wireframing to prioritize speed, security, and user-centric design. Our proposed enhancements aim to provide a unified and intuitive connected experience for users, rethinking Quick Share to introduce features that enhance convenience and versatility.
